This is a full stack note taking application that uses node.js and express.js in the back end. The app is very simple. Title your notes and give them more details underneath. Save any tasks or notes and they will appear in the sidebar. If you need to revisit that note, simply click on the link and it displays the note again. Once you have completed a task or no longer want the note, you can delete the note.
